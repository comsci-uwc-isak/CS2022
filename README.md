# UWC ISAK Computer Science 2022
![](typing.gif)

Welcome! 

Computer Science is an experimental science. From the early days with analog computers breaking war codes [(A.M. Turing)](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/intelligent-machinery-a-heretical-theory) to the modern times with virtual/augmented reality [(Hidden Creative 2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnRJaHZH9lo), cryptocurrencies [(VICE 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-vrdPtZVXc&t=252s), machine learning [(Science Time 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjVIQUE8Sgk) or artificial intelligence [(WSJ 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g) [(DW 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ePZ7OdY-Dw), Computer Science has been at the forefront of technological innovation transforming our lives. At UWC ISAK Japan, the study of Computer Science is pursued using a variety of projects exploring connections with other fields including Art, Neuroscience, Economics, Data Science, and Biology. These projects provide an authentic environment where students can master the syllabus, develop their Computational Thinking Skills while discovering modern technologies.  

In a concise way:

"Computer science requires an understanding of the fundamental concepts of computational thinking as well as knowledge of how computers and other digital devices operate." [IB Computer Science Guide 2017](CompSciGuide.pdf)

"Computational thinking represents a universally applicable attitude and skill set everyone, not just computer scientists, would be eager to learn and use."  [(Wing, Jeanette M. 2006)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf)

Last year in G11 we explored three different projects including the creation of a car rental application, an interplanetary communication system, and a peer-to-peer software development. Using these projects we explored in a non linear way the [syllabus of CS](syllabus.md). See some results from these projects here:

# 3. üí™ The Assessment

The assessment of the IB Computer Science course is detailed in **Table 1**. In our classroom we will use the rubric for CS IA (**Table 2**) to assess the projects proposed for each unit during the year. In addition we will have a combination of ‚ë†„ÄÄmock papers, ‚ë°„ÄÄquizzes, and ‚ë¢„ÄÄprogramming assignments to obtain a proper sample of your growth. The Predicted Grade (PG) is derived from all these components. 

**Table 1.** Description of the assessment components for SL and HL

| Assessment Component                    | Weighting SL | Weighting HL |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Paper 1: (1 h 30 min)                   | 45%          | 40%          |
| Paper 2: Option (1 h)                   | 25%          | 20%          |
| Paper 3: Case Study (1 h)               | -            | 20%          |
| Internal Assessment (IA): (30 h)        | 30%          | 20%          |

Paper 1 includes a combination of short answer questions testing mainly knowledge, understanding, and application of concepts or tools from Topic 1 to 4 (SL) and Topic 1 to 7 for (HL). It also includes structured questions that required extended writing or solutions.

Paper 2 is the option from the syllabus among:
* Option A: Databases
* Option B: Modelling and simulation
* Option C: Web science
* Option D: Object-oriented programming (OOP)

[See one example of a past paper here.](specimenPapers.pdf)

The Internal Assessment (IA) is your opportunity of developing a software application for a real client on a topic of your interest. The rubric for this component (**Table 2**) includes 5 parts:

**Table 2.** Rubric for the CS IA

| Assessment Component                          | Marks        | 
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Criterion A: Planning                         | 6            |
| Criterion B: Record of Tasks (RoT) and Design | 6            |
| Criterion C: Development                      | 12           |
| Criterion D: Functionality (Video)            | 4            |
| Criterion E: Evaluation                       | 6            |

You will get use to read this rubric as we will be using it constantly for the projects explored in every Unit. See the detailed description of the [rubric for the IA here](IArubric.pdf)

# 4. üî• Tools we will use

![](jetbrains.png)

We will use the Integrated Development Editors (IDE) from JetBrains. These are professional grade software tools free for UWC Students. From all the different favours JetBrain I recommend:

1. [Pycharm Edu](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/): Editor for Python
1. [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/): Editor for Web Development
2. [Google Colaboratory](https://www.colab.research.google.com): Online Google drive for Coding

Procedure to install these tools:

1. Create a free account at [JetBrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/), with your UWC ISAK email account. 
1. Apply for a student free license.
![](studentLicense.png)
1. Download the tools and install them in your computer.
1. When the login window appears for the license, use your email address.

**Note**If you are using a school's laptop, you will have to find Rie-san in the IT office and ask her to create the "TEST account for Dr. Ruben". Then, I can authorise the installation.

## GitHub
![](github.gif)

The other tool we will use all the time is [GitHub](github.com). GitHub is a professional drive online that software developers use to store their code and collaborate with their teams.

1. Create a free account at github with your UWC ISAK email.
1. Create a new repository with name Unit 1. A repository is the name for folder in GitHub.
![](createRepoUnit.png)
1. Send me a **nice** email with the link to your repository.

## Snakify
[Snakify](https://snakify.org/en/) is an excellent tool online where you can develop your programming skills. In the length of G11 you will solve about 200 programming exercises on this website.¬†I will be able to track your progress and give your feedback in this website.

1. Create a free account as a Student.
1. Add me as a teacher with the email address: ruben.pinzon@uwcisak.jp
